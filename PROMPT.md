### ✅ Tips
- If your set includes **Div 05 specs**, drop them in—this strengthens material/finish extraction.  
- Keep `{DEFAULT_MATERIALS}` and `{DEFAULT_FINISH}` realistic to your market; the model will override them when plans/specs say otherwise.  
- You can extend `{TARGET_SCOPES}` to include **ladders, bollards, embeds, grating, catwalks, gates/fencing** when needed.

If you want, I can also give you a **one‑click RFQ email stub** you can reuse with vendors, or a compact **Knowify import mapping** tuned to your item categories.
